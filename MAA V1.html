<span class="title">INTRODUCTION</span>
<div class="page">

<p class="text">Music is ever changing, and it's hard to keep up with all of the different types of music we have out there. Most songs seem to combine different genres of music, making it nearly impossible to categorize music into just one genre. Add to that the fact that there are several subgenres, divisions, and branches of music just floating all over the place, and you'll find that music is actually one of the most complex things in existence.  It is nearly impossible to collect every single division of music with explanations into a single book, however here I attempt to explain the broader, more general genres, such as Electronic, New Age, and K-Pop.</p>

<p class="text">Blues is a genre/form that originated somewhere in the early 20th century, brought about by African-Americans living in the south. It is mostly a vocal form of music that's accompanied by instrumentals, lyrical songs that express feelings rather than tell stories. The emotions/feelings, which are usually sad due to romantic issues, are expressed using various vocal and rhythmic techniques. The blues is characterized by microtonal pitch inflections, a three-line textual stanza of the AAB rhyme scheme, and a 12-measure form. The first two and a half measures of each line are usually devoted to singing, while the last measure and a half usually have an instrumental break that repeats or complements the vocal lines. Blues most likely evolved from African spirituals, African chants, work songs, field hollers, rural fife and drum music, revivalist hymns, and country dance music. It may have also been influenced by church music, ragtime, and the popular music of the white population. Like almost every other music genre, it has numerous subgenres, such as country blues, boogie-woogie, Chicago blues, and classic female blues.<br><br>

Blues has deep roots in African-American history in particular, and American history in general. Its creators were slaves, ex-slaves, the descendants of slaves, and African-American sharecroppers who sang as they toiled in the cotton and vegetable fields. The origins of Blues are poorly documented, partly because of racial discrimination in U.S. society, and partly because of the low rate of literacy among rural African Americans at the time. The first public release of blues sheet music might have been "I Got the Blues," published by musician Antonio Maggio in 1908. The first recording by an African American singer was Mamie Smith's 1920 rendition of "Crazy Blues." Reports of blues music in southern Texas and the Deep South were written at the dawn of the 20th century. The first extensive research done about Blues was performed by Howard W. Odum, who published folk songs from Lafayette County Mississippi, and Newton County Georgia. The first noncommercial recordings of blues music were made by Odum for research purposes at the very beginning of the 20th century, but are now lost amongst other things in the past.</p>

<p class="text">Classical music mostly describes music composed from 1750 to 1820, the classical period, which falls between the baroque and romantic periods. The Baroque period oversaw the creation of a number musical genres which maintained a hold on composition for years to come, but the Classical period which saw the introduction of sonata form, a form which has dominated instrumental composition to the present day. With it came the development of the modern concerto, symphony, sonata, trio and quartet to a new peak of structural and expressive refinement. The Classical age began with a number of composers whose names are now largely forgotten, as well as more historically respected names. Classical music is largely made by orchestras. Standardly, modern orchestras are divided into four sections: Strings, which comprises ‘stringed’ instruments such as violins, cellos, and violas. Woodwinds, which  comprises instruments like flutes, piccolos, and oboes. Brass, which comprises the instruments made of brass, such as trumpets, french horns, and trombones.  Percussion, which comprises instruments that are struck to produce sound, such as triangles, pianos, and timpanis.<br><br>

In the middle of the 18th century, Europe started moving towards a new architectural, literal, and artistic style, generally known as Classicism. Classicism sought to emulate Classical antiquity, especially those of Classical Greece. Because of this, Classical music used formality, emphasis on order and hierarchy, and a clearer, cleaner style that used clearer divisions between parts and brighter contrasts and tone colors. In contrast with its predecessor in the Baroque era, Classical music moved towards simplicity rather than complexity, and the size of orchestras began to increase, giving orchestras a more powerful sound.The new style was also affected in part by changes in the economic and social structures. Nobility were patrons of instrumental music, while the public preferred lighter, more comical operas. This led to changes in the way music was performed. A few noteworthy Classical artists are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Mozart was always working, teaching himself to be a better composer and trying to be more than just a maker of music. He attempted to do this in a way that strikes our ears as the purest ever conceived. Beethoven is one of the greatest classical composers, and strove to understand, express, worship and improve thing with his music. Tchaikovsky managed to bring Russian music onto the European map, and had a devotion to Mozart, Bellini and Donizetti. He is best known for his charming and ebullient ballets and piano concerto.<br><br>

Some people criticize classical music for having long pieces, and believe it to be rhythmically weak. They also point out that there’s no text to give the music meaning, and when there are singers— mostly in concerts and opera— their vocal style is contrived and unnatural, with much shrieking and bellowing, and unintelligible words. Culturally, Classical music is the least significant musical form there is, with many modern Classical musicians going unnoticed. But symphonies, concertos, and sonatas are still being written and enjoyed by audiences around the world. The Star Wars theme song is actually a classical piece, composed by John Williams, a modern classical artist who has also done theme songs for the Indiana Jones movies. Many of Mozart's pieces are used to soundtrack movies also, appearing in Last Action Hero and Alien just to name a couple. Warner Bros' Tom and Jerry also use classical music a lot, which greatly enhances the show. Classical music can be calming, exciting, or somewhere in-between, and is still appreciated everywhere.</p>

<span class="title">COUNTRY AND WESTERN</span>
<div class="page">

<p class="text">Country and Western, which is often simply called Country music, is a broader genre that can be used to describe many styles and subgenres, such as western music, cowboy songs, rockabilly, and others. Country music mostly consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms, folk lyrics, and harmonies. It is mostly accompanied by string instruments such as the African instrument banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, steel guitars, and fiddles as well as harmonicas. Blues modes have also been used extensively throughout its recorded history. The singers often have country accents, although sometimes their accent is just barely heard. Generally, Country music doesn’t use many instruments together, and has a simple chord progression, although there are outliers.<br><br> 

Country music was originally called "hillbilly music," but the label was replaced as hillbilly was often used as a derogatory term for people who dwell in rural mountainous areas in the U.S. Country music originated from people who lived in these areas, mostly the Appalachia, and quickly spread. There are currently six generations of Country music. The first generation spans the 1920s, the second spans the 1930s to 1940s, the third spans the 1950s to 1960s, the fourth spans the 1970s to 1980s, the fifth spans the 1990s, and the sixth spans the 2000s up to now. The first commercial recording of country music featuring vocals and lyrics was possibly "Little Log Cabin in the Lane" by Fiddlin' John Carson, which was produced on June 14, 1923. Vernon Dalhart was the first country singer to have a nationwide hit in May 1924 with "Wreck of the Old 97. In April of 1924, Samantha Bumgarner and Eva Davis became the first female musicians to record and release country songs. Other important early recording artists were Riley Puckett, Don Richardson, Uncle Dave Macon, Al Hopkins, Ernest V. Stoneman, Blind Alfred Reed, and The Skillet Lickers.<br><br>

Newer Country music has received criticism for slowly changing to more of a mainstream Pop sound to make Country more acceptable to an urban audience. Others view Country to be a sexist music culture. For example, female stars like Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert are at the same level of superstardom as other famous stars, but don’t sell nearly as many albums or get equitable playing time on the radio. It can also be viewed as racist as well since not many singers of color make it to the top leagues, and are seemingly prevented from doing so, like how Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” was taken down from Billboard country charts due to it ‘not being country enough.’ Still, Country is one of few music styles that are unmistakably American, and is one of the most popular genres in America today.</p>

<span class="title">ELECTRONIC</span>

<p class="text">Electronic is a genre that utilizes electronic musical instruments, which are instruments that produce sound VIA electronic circuitry. Modern electronic music can be found almost everywhere, although the greatest example would lie in the popular genre of Electronic Dance Music, or EDM for short. Electronic Dance Music is an umbrella term that encompasses Dance-Pop, Drum and Bass, Dubstep, Footwork, House, Techno, Trance, Trap, and others. Most of modern electronic music could be considered EDM, although not all. EDM has spread like wildfire across the world, affecting genres from many other cultures, especially western Pop and K-Pop. Not all EDM has the usual chorus that you see in other music styles, as quite a few songs have a long buildup that's quite worth the wait.<br><br>

Rave culture has found a home in EDM (Electronic Dance Music, the main branch of the Electronic genre). A rave is an organized dance party at a nightclub, an outdoor festival, warehouse, or other private property or public spaces, typically featuring performances by DJs, playing a seamless flow of EDM. This leads to some EDM festivals having features of raves, but on a larger, more oftenly commercial scale. On the downside however, law enforcement has posed anti-rave laws and have raided raves in many countries. This is due to the association of illegal drugs. In addition to drug use, raves often take place in non-authorized, secret venues, such as squat parties at unoccupied homes, unused warehouses, or aircraft hangars.<br><br>

It is important to note however that a musical piece doesn't become Electronic simply by being played on an Electronic instrument. A rock piece does not become electronic music by being played on an electronically amplified guitar, and a classical piece doesn't become electronic music if played on an electronic organ. Dance Pop sounds fairly similar to Electronic, but isn’t necessarily considered as such unless an Electronic DJ was involved in the making of the song. Electronic music is produced from a wide variety of electronic sound resources that are recorded on tape and then edited into a permanent form. Generally, electronic music is played through loudspeakers either alone or in combination with ordinary musical instruments, or with use of a DJ table that can affect different aspects of the music such as bass, treble, volume, etc. Some electronic music sounds no different than music you're already used to, while others have a more futuristic sound, and others can even have a more ‘rock’ sound for lack of better words. For example, SVDDEN DEATH’s music mostly has a rock sound, Marshmello’s mostly has a dance pop sound, and Deadmau5’s music mostly has a futuristic sound. Either way, Electronic music is still very enjoyable to listen to.</p>

<p class="text">Folk music is traditional rural music that is often either related to national culture, historical events, personal events, or certain aspects of society. It started out as traditional music with no known author, simply related VIA oral tradition over the years, much like Folk literature. Where a traditional folk song originated is rarely known to its community, leading to the anonymity of the music once being considered a major element of folk music. Folk music can come from anywhere in the world. Every culture and place has their own songs that are passed down through time from generation to generation, songs that have many themes and meanings. For simplicity’s sake, Folk music here is referring to American Folk music. Folk music generally makes use of simple chord progressions, acoustic instruments, simple scales, and simple melodies. The singing that accompanies the instrumentals is generally calm and simple as well. Some people consider artists such as Bob Dylan to not be “Folk musicians” due to their music being sold and marketed for profit. Others take it a bit further and consider that Folk music doesn’t exist anymore, at least not within American culture. Other than this, there aren’t many criticisms of Folk music, if any at all.<br><br>

Traditional Folk songs and other pieces are the result of individual creation, either by villagers or by professional or church musicians whose work is somehow taken up in the folk culture. They typically had a strong nationalistic component, centered on the community rather than focusing on being artistic. Many traditional Folk songs underwent communal recreation, where different people changed up the songs to suit their tastes and needs. Some of the earliest folk musicians include Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger, and Jimmie Rogers. Woody Guthrie is often seen as the first significant contributor to the genre. His earlier works focused on the plight of the working class in the Dust Bowl Midwest, and he and his music were largely associated with the far-left political spectrum, such as socialists and communists. When traditional Folk songs began making their way to records, many artists started to mix the traditional songs with newer material either written by the artists themselves or by other musicians. After Bob Dylan started relying entirely on his own material, other artists started doing the same, making their own music rather than relying on the songs of old. This version of Folk music is referred to as contemporary Folk music. It emerged in the mid 20th century and afterwards, building on the more traditional Folk music.</p>

<span class="title">HIP-HOP</span>
<div class="page">

<p class="text">Hip Hop music, most commonly referred to as “Rap,” is a fairly popular music style that takes its roots from African Americans and Latino Americans who lived in the Bronx borough of New York City. Even though it is often described as “Rap,” rapping actually is not a required component of Hip Hop music, although it most commonly accompanies it, especially in the modern times. It is a stylized rhythmic music that developed as a part of the Hip Hop culture. As rapping became more popular, more DJ and rapper duos formed. DJs started to improve their beats by using different techniques, like sampling short drum breaks and scratching. Rappers also began improving their raps by using more complex rhymes and by developing their flows.<br><br>

At first, Hip Hop music was only performed live, but a Hip Hop song called “Rapper's Delight” was released in 1979, and became a top-ten hit. After the success of Rapper's Delight, many other hip hop records were released. The earliest example of socially conscious Hip Hop is “The Message,” released by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five. It addressed social issues like poverty, crime and the stress of living in a dangerous city. When punk rock group Beastie Boys began shouting raps instead of singing, their style also became very popular. By the end of the 1980s, many hip hop beats were being made in a studio VIA electronic methods, such as drum machines, synthesizers and samples from electronic records. During this time, another style of political Hip Hop developed when Hip Hop groups such as Public Enemy began demanding political change and an ending to social injustices, racism in particular. In the early 1990s, producers began using audio editing software and digital effects to create new styles of alternative hip hop. The Fugees used elements of reggae and soul to create their own new style, and all-girl group Salt-N-Pepa created a fun new style of hip hop pop. Later, rappers like Common and Talib Kweli created a new style of socially conscious Hip Hop when they began rapping about political and social issues over breakbeat grooves by jazz and funk musicians.<br><br>

Most of modern Hip Hop is Trap music, which is typified by layered synthesizers and an overall dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere. Heavy critics of Trap music use the term “mumble rap” to describe the hard to understand, heavily auto-tuned music with little emphasis on lyricism that most Trap artists such as Tekashi 6ix9ine, Lil Pump, XXXTentacion, and Lil Peep. Most mumble rappers also curse heavily, which makes some people shy away from their songs. Critics also point out that quite a few have also led troubled lives, Lil Peep having had a drug addiction that claimed his life, and XXXTentacion having multiple widely publicized legal charges, just to name a couple. Overall, this deducts nothing from them or their music, which was a sort of outlet for most of them. For the most part however, the term “mumble rap” is simply used by people who don’t like certain Hip Hop songs or artists, in the place of “this music sucks” or “I don’t like this.” In fact, mumbling actually has nothing to do with the legitimate definition of mumble rap. It is hard to define what mumble rap is exactly, but it isn’t necessarily a bad thing how most people think. </p>

<p class="text">Jazz is a music style that has been hailed around the world as “one of America’s original art forms,” and originated in New Orleans’ African American communities. Any attempt to arrive at a precise, all-encompassing definition of jazz is probably futile. Jazz has been a constantly evolving, expanding, and changing music, and has passed through several phases of development. A definition that might apply to one phase becomes inappropriate when applied to another segment of its history. Duke Ellington said about Jazz, “It’s all music.” Despite this, Jazz is almost instantly recognized, not getting mixed up with other musical genres. Jazz has all the elements that other music has. Melody, harmony, rhythm, and everything else that makes music music. But what sets jazz apart is improvisation. That means that Jazz is mostly played on the spot. Of course, not ALL Jazz is played on the spot, but a majority of non-commercial Jazz is. Jazz is most commonly played on the saxophone, trumpet, trombone, piano, bass, drums, and/or guitar. The singing that accompanies Jazz music is usually either calming or exciting.<br><br>

Jazz developed in the early decades of the 20th century. It’s rooted in many African American folk music traditions, such as spirituals, work songs, and blues. It also borrowed from 19th century band music and the ragtime style of piano playing. Jazz has been influenced by traditional classical music and popular music. Jazz has a relatively short history. The earliest style recognized as distinctly Jazz tradition is Dixieland, which is called such because the center of its development was in New Orleans. Dixieland Jazz is typically performed by a small ensemble consisting of clarinet, trumpet, and trombone, accompanied by a rhythm section of drum set, banjo or piano, and string bass or tuba. The next distinctive style was Swing, which was performed by a larger group consisting of saxophones or clarinets, trumpets, and trombones. The rhythm section would typically include a piano, string bass, and drum set, with possible additions of guitar or other chordal instruments. The larger group typical of the swing era required composed works in which improvisation could be incorporated. Contemporary Jazz is tougher to describe, as all older Jazz styles continue to be cultivated. New developments have also enriched the tradition. One style is cool Jazz, characterized by technical sophistication and expressive restraint. There’s also fusion jazz, which incorporates many harmonic and rhythmic practices of rock music, and sometimes uses electronic instruments in combination with traditional ones.</p>

<p class="text">K-Pop is a genre that originated in South Korea, and is growing in popularity. The modern form of K-Pop emerged from one of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys. They experimented with different styles and foreign genres, which helped reshape K-Pop. It is hard to define the sound of K-Pop since it takes influence from nearly every genre on this list. K-Pop, despite the name, doesn’t only have a pop-like sound. It is actually an umbrella term for numerous genres and styles of music, with the only similarity being that the musicians, called ‘Idols,’ are South Korean and sing in mostly Korean. K-Pop is largely characterized by catchy beats, and possibly is influenced greatest by the dance pop and electronic genres. However, it also is influenced by R&B, rock, hip hop, and numerous other genres.<br><br>

The first wave of idol groups came soaring in after Seo Taiji and Boys made their mark on K-Pop history. In the 1990s,SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment established the idol making process that has been a successful formula today. Out of the three, SM Entertainment was responsible for assembling a group named “H.O.T” that debuted in 1996. It consisted of five diverse male singers, and offered a little something for everyone, including good looking members, colorful clothing, and funky beats. The idol expansion continued through the 1990s and into the 2000s, churning out groups with a similar formula. As this continued, K-Pop started spreading to Western audiences. One of K-pop's bigger moments for Western audiences came from rapper Psy. The lead single from his studio album "Gangnam Style" went viral, becoming the first YouTube video to reach one billion views. Gangnam Style was far removed from the idol image other groups had worked hard to portray, which made it just bizarre enough to capture a new geographical area's attention. As a result, Western fans started looking for more songs from Korean artists. But the evolution of K-pop has culminated in the success of one of K-Pop boy group BTS. The group has broken records and stereotypes in both their home country and abroad, making huge strides for the K-pop industry as a whole.<br><br>

The idol system is complicated, and controversial in the Western society. Management agencies for the bigger record labels in South Korea hold auditions for trainees starting at ages as young as 8. Trainees live together in a regulated environment, and spend many hours a day learning music, dance, foreign languages and other skills in preparation for their debut. As a result, the system is often looked down on by most westerners, as it is viewed as the violation of the human rights of a minor. Labels/companies invest up to 3 million USD per trainee, gambling on the chances of them becoming a huge hit in the industry. Some companies don’t pay the debut trainees until the huge debt is paid off. Not all trainees become K-Pop idols however, some become actors, models, or other similar things. However, only a small minority of these trainees become popular. Labels YG Entertainment and SM Entertainment are also known for their sexualization of idols. However, while some parts of the K-Pop industry are disappointing to say the least, it does not affect the fantastic quality of their music, which is continuing to spread across the globe.</p>

<p class="text">Latin music is music that comes from Spanish or Portugese speaking countries, or music sung in either language. The term "Latin music" originated due to the growing influence of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the American music market. It started growing in influence in the 1940s, stemming from the fact that many people wanted to forget about World War II momentarily, and therefore made songs and films about Latin America, the one place not engulfed in the war. In modern times, Latin music is dominated by up-tempo rhythms, as Latin ballads and crooners fell out of favor among U.S. Latin radio programmers. Streaming is the dominant form of revenue in the Latin music industry in the United States, Latin America and Spain.</p>

<p class="text">New-age is quite a special genre of music that emerged in the 1970s. It is intended to create artistic inspiration, relaxation, and optimism, and is used for meditation, stress management, reading, yoga, and other calm activities. The use of music instruments along the natural sounds of animals is popular in New-age, and New-age is mostly instrumental, although vocals can be in the music. These instrumental pieces can create various moods, although the intent overall is for them to be relaxing and soothing. New Age music is often intended to represent a vision of a better future and to express an appreciation of goodness and beauty, and rarely dwells on worldly or life problems.</p>

<p class="text">Pop is probably one of the most common genres of music, and originated in the US and the UK. Pop is often described as instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers. Pop is intended to appeal to a general audience rather than a certain group. It has a simple style, and rhythmic element. "Pop" is actually a shortened term that is used in place of "Popular music." With it being so common, this title is very fitting. Pop also sells the most hits in the music industry, and make it to the charts more than other genres of music. For the most part, Pop has easy to remember lyrics, mostly about love and relationships although there are many outliers. The most interesting part is that modern day Pop is mostly played on electronic instruments, although not generally considered to be Electronic music.<br><br>

With Pop being so POPular (forever a pun), most people have grown a liking to it considering most people have been raised on it. However, it is generally the weakest form of music, and is recycled a lot. Plus, Pop music can be disguised as other genres by having just enough elements of that genre in it to pass off as said genre. An example of this is Taylor Swift, a Country singer turned Pop. Pop, like "mumble rap," is sometimes criticized due to the fact that a majority of singers use autotune. Music is music however, and autotune or not, it still takes talent to make music.</p>

<p class="text">Reggae is a genre which emerged in the 1960s, and originated in Jamaica, where it became the dominant music, and ended up linking with the Rastafarian movement. Reggae is in fact an important means of sending messages of the Rastafarian movement to the public. It also can relate news, talk about social injustices, or political commentaries. Reggae has spread across the globe, gaining popularity alongside other genres. It has been thought of as the voice of the oppressed, and rejection of "white man culture." In the 1970s, Reggae spread to the United Kingdom, where Jamaican immigrants and native-born Britons forged a reggae movement. Reggae was also embraced in the United States, mostly through the work of Bob Marley.</p>

<p class="text">Rock is a popular genre that originated as “Rock and Roll.” It draws inspiration from numerous different genres and styles, although it’s centered on the amplified electric guitar for the most part, and usually as a group effort with at least one singer. A Rock band typically consists of 3 to 5 members that includes the “power trio,” which is a lineup of an electric guitarist, bass guitarist, and drummist. Rock has a wide range of themes, and was most likely conceived as an outlet for adolescent yearnings. It emerged in the 1960s, evolving from rock and roll, and pop music. However, it is generally harsher than either genre, and a wider range of lyrics. "Rock" was developed as a term to distinguish the music-making and listening practices from those associated with pop. British legislators originally defined pop music as “all kinds of music characterized by a strong rhythmic element and a reliance on electronic amplification for their performance.” Such a definition failed to differentiate between Pop music and Rock music.</p>

<p class="text">Music is all around us, and has many different forms and styles that appeal to different audiences and have their own histories. Music isn't just an aesthetic, it's an art, one with plentiful history, and will continue to make history. It's hard to categorize music, due to the various similarities in rhythmic and lyrical expression. Which musical form do you enjoy most?</p>
